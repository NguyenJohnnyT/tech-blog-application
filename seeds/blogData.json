You quadruple mask and put on your plastic smock. You gaze longingly at the sky. A man riding his bicycle points his flashlight at you 'Why aren't you doing your stretches and cardio?' He asks, you recognize him as your neighbor (maybe, it's been some time since you last saw anyone). 'It's because of people like you not obeying that the lockdowns have been extended another 4 years.' He mumbles through his layers of masks. He reports you to AlphabetGoogle and your social credit score drops 5 points, good luck buying bread this week.",
